# project-explosion
A template repository for a somewhat opinionated project.

## How opinionated?

Well I'm glad you asked. Kind of? Kind of. 

### Technologies
1. Svelte, for front end rendering
2. Xstate, for modeling complex deterministic states for a complex UI application
3. Modular CSS in conjunction with svelte, to make use of insanely dope CSS post-processing!
